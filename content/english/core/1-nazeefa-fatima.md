**Project lead | Sweden – Norway**

Data Steward. Interests: data management, single-molecule sequencing technologies, web development, UX/UI design, and data visualisation. Bioinformatics isn't just about data, it's about people. Who gets to ask the questions, run the code, and feel that they truly belong. As a team, we want Nordic CompBio to be a space of connections, building together, and supporting each other. We are here to make sure more voices get to shape the future of computational biology.
