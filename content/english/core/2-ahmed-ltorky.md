**Project member | Finland**

I am a PhD student in the field of Systems Biology with interests in Immunology, transcriptomics and single-cell technologies. I appreciate the gesture from the Nordic Computational Biology to welcome, develop and integrate researchers across the nordics and other countries with a light collaborative dynamic.
