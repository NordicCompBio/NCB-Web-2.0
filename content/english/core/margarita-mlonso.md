My interest is mainly immunoinformatics, currently working with B-cell receptor sequences, but in general, I'm interested in systems biology (also its relationship with biostatistics and mathematical modelling), bioinformatics and NGS. I believe that the Nordic CompBio is an excellent opportunity to learn from different people about the field that unites us all as professionals. It also makes possible the visualization and sharing of information and research, which in turn promotes the development of more scientists, generating a positive impact on the scientific world.
