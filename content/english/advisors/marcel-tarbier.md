Assistant professor at Uppsala University and SciLifeLab. My lab develops tools for the computational inference of complex cell features (e.g., lineage relationships and micro-environment) from single-cell gene expression data to better understand cancer heterogeneity and its consequences. In life sciences and medicine, bioinformatics is used as a tool in a wide range of topics, often scattering researchers in environments without critical mass. NCB brings together the Nordic bioinformatics community and enables exchange over the boundaries of fields, workplaces and countries - sparking interaction, new ideas and collaborations.
