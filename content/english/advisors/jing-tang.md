I would like to be part of NCB to develop the community further in the Nordic region, especially Finland. The needs for computational biology are far exceeding the available support, and therefore the NCB needs to act more coherently to engage the researchers, students, as well as funding agencies. I see a great potential for NCB as a central hub for sharing ideas, resources, and activities to promote computational biology across the region.
