NCB provides a platform for connecting researchers across disciplines and countries in the Nordic region. I believe it can play an important role in fostering collaboration and sharing knowledge in computational biology, which is increasingly essential for advancing life sciences. By bringing together diverse experts, NCB has the potential to support the development of new ideas, tools, and partnerships that can benefit the broader scientific community in the Nordics.
