Our group’s computational biology research programme focuses on gene expression regulation and the mechanisms by which it can be disrupted in human diseases such as cancers. In a nutshell, the group develops and applies computational approaches to analyze in house and public multi-omics data to study gene expression dysregulation. There are unparalleled opportunities arising from being part of a scientific community with a common focus and a common goal. The Nordic Computational Biology (NCB) initiative provides such an opportunity to trainees working in the field of bioinformatics in the Nordics. I see the events organized by NBC as catalyst events aiming at sharing knowledge, promoting scientific excellence, providing support, and triggering international and local collaborations on computational biology and statistical research projects related to molecular biology. I believe that it is an exciting forum to strengthen computational biology in the Nordics.
