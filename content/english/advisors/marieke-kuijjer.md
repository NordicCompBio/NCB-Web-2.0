My group’s research focuses on developing computational frameworks that place genomic data into the context of gene regulatory networks and on exploring how these networks influence complex disease, with a main focus on cancer. Thoughts on Nordic CompBio: Many of the tools and methodologies that computational biologists develop and use can be applied to or extended in a wide variety of settings and projects. Through connecting researchers from different career stages and across the Nordic countries, I hope that the NCB platform will spark creativity, increase collaborations, and create a more collective and open approach to doing research.
